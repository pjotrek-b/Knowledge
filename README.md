# Knowledge
A collection of slides/presentations I've held over the years on different topics.

I am not sure how to deal with the image sources (for now).
Therefore it's text-only (for now).

# Dependencies:

## Pandoc

I'm using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert my Markdown to reveal.js HTML/Javscript code (see below).
Specifically, I'm relying on [pandoc's reveal template](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/blob/master/default.revealjs) to do so.

## Reveal.js

This is the actual code that makes the presentations "come alive":

## Decktape: Rendering PDFs

For automated (Makefile/shell) rendering the HTML presentations into PDFs, I'm using [Decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape).
