# Open Source

> &ldquo;Just using '<strong>open stuff</strong>' won't fix your problems.<br />
> It might even make things worse.&rdquo;

<small>
<p class="fragment">
...which btw applies to <strong>any</strong> digital system/tool, if not incorporated or used
properly. Independent of its license.
</p>
</small>


<aside class="notes">
Adressing this, because of archivist's reply in Frankfurt:
&ldquo;We used OpenSource as free alternative for 'the real X', but it didn't work as
well as 'the real X', so we gave up and bought 'the real X'.&rdquo;
</aside>


# Popular "mistakes"

  * Underestimating environmental- and starting conditions.
  * Do you value "digital freedoms" or just looking for cheap?
  * No continuous allocation of resources  
    (time *or* money).
  * No community involvement: "*I'm not a coder*".

<aside class="notes">
<small>
    Environmental / starting conditions:
    <ul>
        <li>especially (tech-)knowhow, because: You either have to pay -or- DIY.</li>
        <li>staff moral / willingness to "question mainstream".</li>
        <li>Lack of interfaces with proprietary systems.</li>
        <li>Unexpected vendor lock-in.</li>
        <li>Proprietary file formats / dialects of open standards...</li>
    </ul>
</small>
</aside>


# (Your) reasons to use FOSS?

> &ldquo;I need a <strong>free</strong> alternative for X,
> because we ain't got enough budget to get the <strong>real</strong> X.&rdquo;

# (Your) reasons to use FOSS?

> &ldquo;Your stuff's for free, right?<br />
> Good, because we need the money to pay proprietary vendor-lock-in system X.&rdquo;

# (Your) reasons to use FOSS?

> &ldquo;We want to study/share/improve our digital workflows.
> Do you know a FOSS system we could use or build on?&rdquo;


# Define Free/Real?

<small>

|  Free X:                                 |  Real X:                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
|  Gratis?  | The "Wow! you can afford that? I'm jealous." option?  |
|  Cheap - as in "unprofessional" or less valuable/reliable/awesome? | The professional tool?  |
|  Worth less than non-free (water...)?  |  The number one that everyone uses?  |
|  Freedom to Use, Study, Share &amp; Improve (USSI)?  |  The one with the great GUI?  |
|  Part of a digital commons infrastructure?  |  The well-supported one?  |
</small>

<aside class="notes">
Different definitions of "free" change the outcome.
Any software is as good as what the user "expects" it to be.
Bad software + excellent PR/image = perceived as great software ;P
And the other way around.
</aside>


# What if...

> Real = Free?

  * Any reason <strong>not</strong> to want that?
  * How much would that be worth to you?
  * Do you expect free to be as good as non-free (water)?

<aside class="notes">
    Is this even possible?
    Well, if FOSS was the supported mainstream we'd be pretty close to that.
</aside>

# Unpossible?!

<aside class="notes">
Compare it to: claiming a forest is a stable ecosystem - and possible - but noone ever saw a forest, and challenge you to prove it.
By letting you plant a tree (from seed) on a heavy-traffic highway.

    At least here the tree will survive. But will it become a self-sustaining forest?

# Infrastructure?  
## Taxes?

  * Good: Most publicly funded projects now require FOSS license :)
  * But: Public institutions sometimes not "allowed" to pay for FOSS :(
  * Demand/help change of rules:  
    Public Money? Public Code! <small>([https://publiccode.eu/]())</small>

How to make sure projects we like, or rely on, stay alive and flourish?


# Abandoned orphans

**Top reasons for FOSS developers to leave a project:**

  * lack of interest
  * lack of patience
  * lack of resources (time/money)
  * change of profession
  * creative differences

<aside class="notes">
    These reasons actually apply to: "why someone quits a job".
    Therefore also to proprietary software, but you just don't see it that often from "outside", as it's company-internal dynamics.

    Providing means for developers to stay on, or adopt a project will not
    only avoid it becoming abandoned, but will improve its qualities:
    stability, features and GUI.

    <!--
    It btw hurts if you see your program in use on almost every computer in
    the world, but you have to book a 6 bed hostel dorm for this
    conference, while being laughed at by proprietary competitors who enjoy
    spending their users money on unnecessarily expensive hotel suites.

    That's why proprietary software seems superior sometimes:<br />
    <strong>You</strong> make them <strong>afford</strong> to work on it.
    Even if you don't pay them directly.

# Taken for granted?

  * Who of you is using:  
    <small>
    Mediainfo, VLC, Wikipedia, Firefox, FFmpeg, QCTools, Linux, etc...?
    </small>

  * What if they disappear?
    ![](../../images/misc/emoji_shock.png){width="64px" class="plain"}

  * What's your (institution's) plan to keep these applications alive and kicking?


# How much do you value 'IT'?

<aside class="notes">
    Difficult to judge the value of immaterial goods in our society...
    So what about real stuff?
    Let's try comparison with food and sustainable environment.
</aside>


# Your preference?

  1. Industrial, patented, lock-in seeds, exploit nature for profit
     <span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
     <strong> (= Proprietary) </strong>
     </span>

  2. organic, sustainable, community, handmade
     <span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
     <strong> (= FOSS) </strong>
     </span>


<small>

  * Which one's required for sustainable long-term?
  * Which one's the current mainstream?
  * Which profits whom?
  * Which one has the shinier apples?

</small>


# You are 'The Community'

![](../../images/open_source/not_a_coder-contribute.png)


# Contributions

  * Value FOSS like fresh air or clean water.
  * Offer your time or money.
  * Write documentation.
  * Publish tutorials.
  * Design graphics.
  * Testing.
  * Raising funds.
  * Demand FOSS and open file formats.
  * ...


# Summary

  * Environmental- and starting conditions matter.
  * Encourage and value "digital freedoms".
  * Contribute, if possible :)
  * Allocate continuous resources (time <em>or</em> money)
  * Think long-term &amp; in collaborations.
