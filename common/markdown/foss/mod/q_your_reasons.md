# Define Free/Real?

<small>

|  Free X:                                 |  Real X:                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
|  Gratis?  | The "Wow! you can afford that? I'm jealous." option?  |
|  Cheap - as in "unprofessional" or less valuable/reliable/awesome? | The professional tool?  |
|  Worth less than non-free (water...)?  |  The number one that everyone uses?  |
|  Freedom to Use, Study, Share &amp; Improve (USSI)?  |  The one with the great GUI?  |
|  Part of a digital commons infrastructure?  |  The well-supported one?  |

<aside class="notes">
Different definitions of "free" change the outcome.
Any software is as good as what the user "expects" it to be.
Bad software + excellent PR/image = perceived as great software ;P
And the other way around.
