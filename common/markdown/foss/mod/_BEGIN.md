Open Source in AV Archives

Abstract:

With todays omnipresence of digital and the speed and complexity of software
development and interactions, even major software companies need to embrace
FOSS, as the current software ecosystem would otherwise be unsustainable.

Within the archival domain, paid-support Free-and-Open-Source Software (FOSS)
has already proven as a good match to provide digital archivists with set of
common and highly-professional go-to tools. In this workshop, I'll present some
valuable programs - and useful tricks using Open Source for AV-preservation
tasks.

From commandline to GUI.  Aimed at beginners and anyone interested in stable
working environments.

<!--
Plan:

  * Intro What is FOSS (and what it's NOT)
  * Looong list of existing tools/solutions provided as/by FOSS community.
    Not intended to be read, but simply to show the vast amount of things
    that exist to be used.

  * Show screenshots from Apple/Google/Facebook/etc "promoting" (=using) OpenSource?
    - soit's serious and professional, alright.

  * Professional FOSS:
    - funding plans included.
    - FFmpeg
        FFV1, streamhash, etc
    - MediaArea and my stuff as example
    - Mediathek funded format conformance checks

  * Who is "the community"?
  
  * Roads & Bridges

  * AV Examples:
    * Identify formats: Trinity Testset with VLC/MediaInfo
    * Show MediaConch
    * vrecord/vrecordX
    * CInbox

  * ...to generic "


  * Tools:
    * Mediainfo, mediaconch
      * Mediathek: MP4/WAV checker
    * Archivematica, AtoM, CInbox, DVA-Profession, DV-Rescue
    * vrecord/vrecordX
    * FFV1, libx264
    * VLC
    * mpv (AmPv, mention Mediathek support)
    * LibreOffice
    * FFmpeg (...which brings us to CLI)
    * libx264, libx265, opus, speex, vorbis, etc.
      too much? at least xvid and x264 and lame.


  * A bit of commandline intro
    * directory listing as CSV
    * download "a list of files" from YT (yt-dlp)?
    * Renumbering image sequence (DPX/TIFF)

  * And behind the scenes:
    (mention this, then let it be)
    * GNU/Linux:
      as server/client OS
    * MySQL/MariaDB:
      The Database.
    * Samba:
      The file transfer demon.
    * rsync:
      The file-copy/sync tool.
    * Apache/nginx:
      The webserver
    * VirtualBox, KVM/Qemu:
      The virtualization environment
