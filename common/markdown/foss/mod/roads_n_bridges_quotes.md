> "Everybody relies on shared code to write software, including 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500">Fortune 500 companies</a>, government, major
  software companies and startups. In a world driven by technology, we are putting
  increased demand on those who maintain our digital infrastructure. Yet because
  these communities are not highly visible, the rest of the world has been slow to
  notice."

> "In the face of unprecedented demand, the costs of not supporting our digital
  infrastructure are numerous. No individual company or organization is
  incentivized to address the public good problem alone. In order to support our
  digital infrastructure, **we must find ways to work together.**"
