# What is "Open Source"?

GPL (GNU General Public License),  
gives these "4-freedoms" on software:

  1. **Use**
  2. **Study**
  3. **Share**
  4. **Improve**

And forces these rights to stay.

# Free Software / Open Source is:

  * NOT Freeware
  * NOT just for Linux/Commandline
  * NOT unprofessional
  * NOT the opposite of "commercial"


# Free? Open? Libre?

> **FOSS** = Free and Open Source Software

> Free was in "free speech",  
> not as in "free beer".

<aside class="notes">
The term "Free Software" refers to freedoms and strong "Copyleft".
The term "Open Source" was coined to make it (mentally) easier for "the industry" to pick it up as development model.
