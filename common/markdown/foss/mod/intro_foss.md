# What is "Open Source"?

GPL (GNU General Public License),  
gives these "4-freedoms" on software:

  1. **Use**
  2. **Study**
  3. **Share**
  4. **Improve**

And forces these rights to stay.


# Free Software / Open Source is:

  * NOT Freeware
  * NOT just for Linux/Commandline
  * NOT unprofessional


# Free? Open? Libre?

> **FOSS** = Free and Open Source Software

> Free was in "free speech",  
> not as in "free beer".
