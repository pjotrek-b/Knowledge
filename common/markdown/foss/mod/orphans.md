    These reasons actually apply to: "why someone quits a job".
    Therefore also to proprietary software, but you just don't see it that often from "outside", as it's company-internal dynamics.

    only avoid it becoming abandoned, but will improve its qualities:
    stability, features and GUI.

    the world, but you have to book a 6 bed hostel dorm for this

    spending their users money on unnecessarily expensive hotel suites.
