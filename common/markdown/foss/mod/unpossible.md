Compare it to:

Claiming a forest is a stable ecosystem - and possible - but
noone ever saw a forest, and challenges you to prove it.

By letting you plant a tree (from seed) on a heavy-traffic highway...

How would your vision of "a forest or even jungle" work out that way?


But what if you had the chance to spread free seeds over a vast space of fertil
ground...?
What if you had the right starting conditions, and a critical mass?
