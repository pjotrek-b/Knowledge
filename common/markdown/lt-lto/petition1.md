# LongTerm-LTO Generations

## Whoever:

  - is dealing with large amounts of (heritage? science? other?) data that has
    great use for LTO digital tape as storage medium.
  - and does not want to force-upgrade LTO-generations so often.
  - requires year-long readability.

## Would like to have LTO that:

  1. stays the available / compatible - simply *unchanged* for years to come
  2. has "long-term support" generation(s) - eg 20y marks?
     (like LTS versions of software/OS)

  3. has retro-fitting or compatibility options of any kind.

  4. all parts and documentation needed to retro-fit drives to a different
     generation: firmware and heads (mechanics compatible).

Anyone signing here would be willing to pool resources to fund such an ongoing support partnership.

Starting with celebrating a "feature-freeze" of LTO-6/8 - and continuing to
produce and support either both, or v8 of these 2 LTO-generations.

What is needed to get access and resources needed to simply "continue a good
product as-is"? ⭐️"

Looking forward to hearing from interested partner factories and manufacturers of the current LTO hardware for "GLAMorous" use and support.

Thank you very much in advance.

Sincerely, yours...
