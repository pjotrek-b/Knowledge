<aside class="notes">
Notice that the pixel resolution is almost always (or at least should be) an even number?
With lossy-compression, it is even mandatory to have multiples of 8 or 16 pixel (blocks).

Popular example `digital NTSC`:

  * "Original" resolution `720 x 486px`
  * h.264 (et al) require resolution to be divisible by 4
  * 486 / 4 = 121.5 üò•Ô∏è
  * Therefore cropping required: `720 x 480px`

# CFR: Constant Framerate

Each frame has a fixed (=constant) duration.

# VFR: Variable Framerate

Each frame has an arbitrary (=variable) duration.

# MediaInfo Report of VFR

![](../../../images/tech-video/fps/mediainfo_vfr.png)


# Variable Framerate

  * No constant image frequency.
  * Each frame has individual display duration.
  * Was rather uncommon.
  * But came back increasingly with smartphone/tablet recordings.
  * Mixing CFR and VFR: "Something's gotta give"
  * May produce "*unusual*" frame rates when checking (because average).

# Audio

  * Samplerate
  * Bits per sample (bit depth)
  * Channels


# Samplerate

![](../../../images/tech-audio/audio-signal_sampling.png){ width=90% }



# Hertz? kHz?

> Samplerate is given as frequency:  
> `1 kHz (Kilohertz) = 1000 Hz (Hertz)`

Each audio sample is literally just a number.
Representing the audio volume (voltage) at that position.

<p class="fragment">
**Example Audio CD:**  
44.1 kHz = 44100 samples per second

# Audio Channels

  * 1 = mono
  * 2 = left + right (stereo, dual-mono)
  * &gt; 2 = multi-channel
  * ...

> Preserve, and/or document the source track/channel layout.



# Audio: Tracks &amp; Channels

  * Each AV file can have multiple tracks
  * Each track can have n channels
  * Common: 1 stereo (=2 channels) track per language
  * Broadcast: 8 individual tracks, 1 channel each.
  * ...

> Audio channel mapping is another story...

# Samplerate: How much?

> "Sufficient" samplerate = 2\*max(f)
> (at least) **twice the highest frequency** of to-be-sampled content.

<small>(See [Nyquist‚ÄìShannon sampling theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem))</small>

![](../../../images/tech-audio/nyquist_sampling.gif){ width=80% }


<aside class="notes">
For audio, we assume that a common audible range for humans are from 20 to 20000 Hz (20kHz).
The older you get, the lower this value usually becomes.

Generally a nice read is "[Wikipedia: 44,100 Hz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/44,100_Hz)".

Here's a quote:

> "The Nyquist‚ÄìShannon sampling theorem says the sampling frequency must be
> greater than twice the maximum frequency one wishes to reproduce. Since human
> hearing range is roughly 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, the sampling rate had to be
> greater than 40 kHz.

So why 4.1 kHz more then?

> In addition, signals must be low-pass filtered before sampling to avoid
> aliasing. While an ideal low-pass filter would perfectly pass frequencies
> below 20 kHz (without attenuating them) and perfectly cut off frequencies
> above 20 kHz, such an ideal filter is theoretically and practically
> impossible to implement as it is noncausal, so in practice a transition band
> is necessary, where frequencies are partly attenuated. The wider this
> transition band is, the easier and more economical it is to make an
> anti-aliasing filter. **The 44.1 kHz sampling frequency allows for a 2.05 kHz
> transition band.**"

Twice the transition band of `2.05` = `4.1`.
Tataaa! :)
