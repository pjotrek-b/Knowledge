# Overview

  * What are "updates"?
  * Why and when are they necessary?
  * Why and when do they (currently) happen?
  * Forced updates
  * Security updates
  * Disruption of "flow" due to unexpected/undesired update(timing)s?


# Stable?

  * Fuck stable: stay agile. stay alert. burn out or die trying?
  * Imagine:
    * Office 2000
    * PC hardware from 2010
    * Feels good?
  * Changelog anyone?

-->


----------------------------------------


# Change is good.

> "Denn, Stillstand ist der Tod".


# Too fast?

> But permanent, too frequent change is torture
> that makes us confused, nervous and stupid.
> And sick.


# Getting a picture?

Recently, in the year 2024...

  * 80+ years old photographer
  * Digital camery (>15y old)
  * Happily using WinXP <small>(in 2024!)</small>
  * Knowing his way around "this setup"
  * Use case = stable and done.

<aside class="notes">
He needs to get a new photo-printer though:
Because the color cartridges for that model ain't produced anymore.
(printer's working fine btw)

Will the new printer work with WinXP?
Anything anyone could do about this?

Got drivers?
Got tech-specs?
Got code?
Got time?

Got a degree in computer science?
</aside>


# Looking forward to...?

The new version of ...

  * Windows?
  * Office?
  * Your "phone"?
  * ...anything you use daily and just need to work?
  * ...something you're absolutely content with, the way it is?


# ...aaaand: it's gone.

  * EOL = End Of Life.
  * Hardware fine, but: Got drivers?
  * Update broke things: No rollback option?
  * Interfaces upgraded?

<aside class="notes">
Oh, let's not forget all the cases where you're a happy owner/user of something
that's not even produced/supported anymore - but it serves you well?

Maybe your grandparent's kitchen-tool or something "ancient" like my beloved
MP3 player?

Or anything else really.
</aside>


# Look around you...

How "old" and not-updated/changed are things around you in your daily
(non-digital) parts of life?

For good reasons.


# Love construction sites?

  * In general?
  * At work?
  * At home?
  * All the time?

Especially infrastructure?

<aside class="notes">
How would you like your physical world to change as often and arbitrarily and
vendor-determined, preferred remotely and without the option to "opt out"?

And this means: anything can change.
At all times. At will. Of someone else.

And those invididual vendors (of your water sinks, toilet, any tool, appliance
- even light switches - anything - may (or may not) change at all times. Maybe
just a bit. Maybe completely.

Maybe some feature of your toaster, pan, radio, toilet, bathtub - anything -
may not be "worth supporting" anymore.

Even though there was no need for a change - FROM YOUR SIDE.
</aside>


# Ever cooked in someone else's kitchen?

  * Where's the stuff you need?
  * Each pot/pan/stove feels the same, right?
  * Want to be in a hurry finding your (new) way around?
  * Want all this to change all the time?

<aside class="notes">
Even when preparing a meal you know by heart and have prepared a million times:
Having a different pot, stove - "tools" needs some time getting used to.

For example in a kitchen on vacation.
Eggs for breakfast anyone?
Simple. Right?

  * How does it feel to know (or not know) your way around in a kitchen/working place?
  * How does it feel to know (ot not know) your tools?

This adjustment/orientation phase is vitally necessary - and everyone needs it
- and time to digest it.
</aside>



# Playing an instrument?

  * Imagine instruments being "updated" like software.
  * You think the artists would mind?

> Same applies to *any* tool/thing/environment anyone needs a level of
> expertise and flow to work with.


<!-- --------------------------------------------- -->


# What are "updates"?

  * Provide new features
  * Fix bugs
  * Fix security issues
  * To improve things in general


# Why and when are they necessary?

  * Interconnected systems 
  * One change/upgrade may require others.
  * Beware:  
    A single Bit can make or break anything...


# Why and when do they (currently) happen?

  * At your will?
  * At will of your "provider"?
  * Automatically?
  * Scheduled/planned?
  * Never?


# Update frequencies?

> "There may be more updates in 6 months now than the total of updates from
> 1995 to 2005"

With everyone relying more than ever on digital-things to "just work".

<aside class="notes">
Since win10:
Updates can only be postponed for a max duration of 3 months (90 days).
Then your system *will* upgrade whatever is decided by your vendor.
</aside>



# Changelog anyone?

  * What actually *has* changed (and why)?
  * Do I need it?
  * Will it affect a critical component I don't want to change (right now)?


<!-- todo: screenshot changelog k9mail -->



# Updates make sense, but...

  * Forced updates?
  * Security updates?

> "I'm old enough and know what I'm doing"


-------------------------------------------

# Security updates

> "Mandatory. For security reasons."

Otherwise...?
You're ready to take full responsibility for... "IT"?


# Security updates

<small>
Life lived in fear, you need protection,
Youâ€™re all alone, too much rejection,
We have what you need, just reach out and touch
We can save you.

We just need your **compliance**.
<small>

<!-- Borg image? -->



# Security updates: Done right.

There are common rules.

  * Must not change features or break APIs
  * Usually only very few and minor changes/patches necessary



-------------------------------------------


# But: New is always better!

  * Quality improvements require feedback.

  * User/vendor feedback-cycle is broken.

  * Why bother, if the "version" is already "too old"?

<aside class="notes">
Do you feel reliability and quality has increased with faster and more updates?
Would you like to provide valuable experiences/feedback with a product?

Too old with a specific software version is what?

  * 6 months?
  * 1 year? 2 years? 5 years?
</aside>


# Things need time.

  * We need time.

  * Planning & development needs time (without changes).


<aside class="notes">
  * We need time.
    Time to sort things out and time getting to know things.

  * Planning & development:
    Requires even more time - without changes.
    API/tool changing while you were developing for and around it?
</aside>
