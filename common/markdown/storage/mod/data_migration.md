  * There is no final carrier.
  * There is no evergreen format.

> Therefore fact: Any data must sooner or later be migrated.

# Eternal Migration

  * Always consider how to get your data out of any system *before* you get
    into it.
  * Or at least while it's still running.
  * As vendor- and technology neutral as possible.
  * Try that *before* you buy.
  * Include migration in your planning.


<aside class="notes">
It’s like brushing your teeth or cleaning things:
It has to be done and is part of the natural life cycle.
Don’t avoid it - include it.
