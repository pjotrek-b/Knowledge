<aside class="notes">
When considering a storage for long-term preservation, at least the following
layers/components should be considered:

  * Application required to read/write data
  * Operating system
  * Hardware it runs on
  * Filesystem
  * Drive (e.g. for tapes, optical media)
  * Physical carrier (medium)

On top of that (but independent of the storage type chosen) are additional
layers of the file itself:

  * container format
  * video format
  * audio format
  * metadata format
  * ...

Similar principles for selecting a file format apply to selecting a long-term
storage solution.
