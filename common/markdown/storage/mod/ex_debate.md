# Storage Debate! 

<aside class="notes">
Make 2 groups:

  * One group for "all in-house"
  * One group for "all external"
  * Think of "pros" why your scenario is a good choice.
  * Afterwards we'll get back and debate.

# Storage Debate: Summary?

  * Online/Cloud: For "smaller" files
    <small>(eg Access copies, documents)</small>
  * Decide which level of control you *want* to have over your data.
  * Large storage: You may want/need to get external support.
  * Mixing (again) is a good idea.
  * **Should we archives outsource all knowhow/skills about digital storage?**
