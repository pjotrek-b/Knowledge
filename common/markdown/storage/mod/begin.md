# Abstract

Storing digital assets is nothing new.

Yet, just "storing files on some carrier" doesn't seem to be enough when the
requirement is "as long and proper as possible".

When it comes to managing vast amount of material with ever-growing data sizes
on ever-changing technologies and expectations, it's good to know at least a
little bit about which properties to base decisions on.

Harddisk vs LTO vs SSD vs BluRay?  Which role does a DAM/MAM play, and what to
look out for?  What if conditions change, or disaster strikes?  How to balance
features and budget?

This session will be an interesting voyage through the important components of
storing and managing digital AV material - even for non IT staff.
