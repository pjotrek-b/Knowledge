# Object storage

  * Files become "objects".
  * There are no (actual) folders. <small>(Foldername = Plain Metadata)</small>
  * There's just an identifier.
  * Arbitrary metadata may be assigned to each "object".
  * Scales infinitely <small>(theoretically)</small>
  * Clusters of block storages with clever abstraction layers.
  * Quite a complex construct of APIs, layers and components. Fascinating.

You may have been using object based storage on Google Drive or Amazon S3.

Pretty cool, but it handles very differently from any regular file/folder based
storage!  Please do your homework before deploying this.

It is still pretty new and if done wrong, it can cause more troubles/effort
than a regular, hierarchical FS storage.

What is often left out by marketing:

  * Underneith, it is still using block storage.

  * Just with clever abstraction layer(s).

  * Important: Your toolchain needs to be object-storage-aware!  Regular,
  well-known tools cannot easily access object files as it used to be.

  * I mention it here, because if done right, it scales.

I'm pretty sure, this is the future - and (at least large scale) storage will
be going from classical (filesystem-based) to this (=object based) way.

# Object Storage = The Future?

![](../../../images/misc/doc_brown_painting.jpg){width=20% style="float:right"}

Object based storage may very likely replace hierarchical filesystems
<small>(but things need to be rewritten/adapted to properly support it.</small>

**It's not yet (really) plug-compatible with existing programs.**




# Object Storage = MAM?

  * The object filesystem **is an actual catalogue**
  * If implemented well, the storage itself may be a future DAM/MAM.
  * Links/relationships between objects = ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤ ðŸ¥³
  * Combined with LoD, MD Standards & APIs = Wikidata for your files.
  * No more distance between file and its catalogue entry.

Just an idea so far, but maybe...?

<aside class="notes">
There is great potential in Object Based Storage.

OBS are already in production usage for a few years by major (online cloud)
storage service providers. Yet, the "catalogue" world, including the WWW are
still mostly running and "thinking" in hierarchical filesystems. DAMs and MAMs
are currently a middleware layer for trying to link files and "other stuff
related to them" in a way that solely serves: Search and Retrieval.

A basic condition for this to work well is that it is implemented using open
and interoperable standards.

Then, any metadata, any relationship - and additional description or history that would be assigned to a data-file over its lifecycle would simply accumulate as part of its object-record.
On filesystem-level.

The default file manager would function as a very basic asset-management system.
It already does so, but in a crude, not-so-interoperable way. And the metadata fields available are currently very file-format related, since often stored inside the file itself.

If moving the paradigm from "metadata in a file", plus the "rest in a separate,
decoupled database" to a "no metadata inside the file, since the file is now an
object, and that object can have certain basic metadata fields by its new
"nature":

  1. objects can be file-data or metadata-only.
  2. +keywords / tags
  3. +name = value pairs (as much as your hardware can handle)
  4. +relationships between objects (as many as your hardware can handle)
  5. relationships are themselves just regular "objects"

This is currently just an idea...
