  * Storage market focus may deviate from your use case <small>(=preservation)</small>
  * Business "longterm": 3-5 years <small>(=product lifecycle)</small>
  * Market focus affects prices, features and reusability.
  * **Who owns your storage = owns your work.**


<aside class="notes">
  * Business focus is usually on high availability, speed and least downtime
    = fast replacement, not necessarily compatibility or long lasting components.

  * Spare parts:
    Professional hardware is good, but:
    Often incompatible with standard components, due to proprietary plugs,
    pinouts, form-factor, etc.

    I've seen cases where whole rack-mounted hardware servers/JBODs had to be
    replaced because it was not possible to get spare power supply units (PSUs) or
    even ventilation fans for this proprietary layout.

    If you can, get good quality hardware with vendor-neutral replacement
    possibilities. Available beyond 3-5 years after purchase.


And if you like it or not:
Who controls your storage, or may decide what/if/how/when - owns control
over your work.
