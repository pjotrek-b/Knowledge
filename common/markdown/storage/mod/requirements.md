Really, "just space"?

Digital archival storage is more than "just large diskspace".

# Archival Storage
## More than "just space":

  * Physical carrier
  * Structure / Order
  * Access control
  * Monitoring
  * Stock keeping
  * Scalability
  * Routine automation
  * ...

## Backup &amp; Migration!

# Physical carrier

![](../../../images/storage/hardware/backblaze.png){width=40% style="float:right"}

  * How much space?
  * How fast?
  * Which use case(s)?
  * How expensive?
  * <span class="fragment">Which level of long-term?</span>



# Structure / Order

![](../../../images/storage/storage_rack.png){width=20% style="float:left"}
![](../../../images/storage/labels.png){width=20% style="float:left"}

  * Folder structure?
  * File naming (conventions)?
  * (Unique) Identifiers?



# Access control

![](../../../images/storage/access_rights.png){width=30% style="float:right"}

  * User accounts?
  * Access rights management?
  * Legal issues? <small>(secrecy, copyright, etc)</small>
  * Which use cases?
  * Accidential human errors?



# Monitoring

![](../../../images/storage/sensorgraph.png){width=30% style="float:right"}

  * Hardware okay?
  * Data growth within expectation?
  * Temperature / humidity?
  * Access logs?
  * Data intact? <span class="fragment">(‚¨ÖÔ∏è  =Stock keeping)</span>



# Stock keeping

![](../../../images/storage/staubwedel.png){width=30% style="float:right"}

  * Fixity checks?
  * Integrity checks?
  * Got hashcodes?
  * Got (run)time?

<aside class="notes">
Do not underestimate the pure runtime of any digital integrity checks.

This is the time to:

  1. Access the data (eg load tape)
  2. Read the data as-is
  3. Calculate hashcodes

</aside>



# Scalability

![](../../../images/storage/construction_plan.png){width=30% style="float:right"}

  * Got a plan?
  * Copy everything? üòíÔ∏è
  * Combining mixed technologies? üíïÔ∏è
  * Costs?
  * ...



# Routine automation

![](../../../images/misc/dltp_automation.jpg){width=30% style="float:right"}

  * Which workflows access your data?
  * Automated transcoding?
  * Virus checks?
  * Indexing: Finding your stuff?
  * ...
