  * No internet = No service.

  * Make sure your online bandwidth is sufficient.

  * Have an exit plan for migration <sup>(+contract?)</sup>

  * What if their conditions change?

  * Where is your data actually stored?

  * Does it matter for you? <sup>(e.g. legally)</sup>

<aside class="notes">
The term "Cloud" in computing came from marketing, and describes nothing else
than digital services that already existed for over 20 years - but now had a
nicer GUI and focus on convenient usability.

There's "[cloud storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_storage)" (e.g. Owncloud/Nextcloud, Dropbox, etc)
and "[cloud computing/services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)" (GDocs, etc).

In this context we will only deal with "cloud storage".


Storing data in large data centers is very convenient. All the same challenges
regarding large-scale storage still apply, but they're someone else's problem
now :)

What's still relevant for you though is:

  * What happens if the provider changes their conditions?
  * What happens in case of unstable political situations, war, etc?
  * What if you want to migrate your stuff to another storage/provider?
  * Does it matter (e.g. legally) if the provider could access your data?
