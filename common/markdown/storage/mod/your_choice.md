Choose a use-case and try to phrase your wishes and requirements.

Now, according to the MoSCoW method, write down which features you:

  * must have
  * should have
  * could have
  * won't have (this time)

And check which storage option provides them, then draw a dot in the
corresponding circle area.

It makes perfect sense to fill these lists even if you're not a technician.
Having such a list is then an excellent entry point for consulting someone
to help you, fill and translate your demands into a proper "solution".
