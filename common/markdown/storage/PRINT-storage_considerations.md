# How much size is needed: now & growing?



# What’s the desired level of long-term?



# Which carrier type(s) are you storing on?



# Which use cases does it need to address?



# Which functions are in place?
(access control, monitoring, integrity checks, etc)



# Which automated actions are in place/desired?



# Tiering support?



# How can it be scaled if you run out of space?



# What’s the life expectancy of the storage?
