The following is not a quiz, but merely a question-checklist that can help to
assess the status of backup/restore routines, as well as data integrity
validation in an archive. These questions were put together based on practical
experience, so that these answers can help save precious time (and troubles)
when a restore is actually needed.

It is best to go through these questions together
with the technicians responsible for backup/restore.



# How is the backup/restore done?


# Who takes care of the backup?


# Who can do a restore?


# Is the restore being tested before needed?


# When/why is a backup restored?


# How can integrity of backup be verified?


# How long is the expected "restore downtime"?
