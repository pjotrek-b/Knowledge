# Abstract

Choosing any digital asset management system is a huge commitment, and
configuring the system to support a given data model (eg a certain ISO
Standard), is quite a non-trivial task.

There are certain things one would like to:

  * get right
  * avoid in the first place
  * have better metadata in the end
  * exchange data with others

What are controlled-vocabularies? keys-values? relationships? agents? LoD?
iso639? XSDs? - and how to make your life easier when dealing with
importing/exporting or implementing metadata layouts in a (media) asset
management system.

This may also influence your choice of DAMs:
Can it handle *your* data structure needs?
-->



<!--
Ideas:

  * mention basic ISO standards (date/time, lang, countries, etc)
  * don't invent your own terms, if there's a better source to reference
  * before you start anything new:
    Unless you're the only one with "that kind of collection":
    Speak with others who are in the same "business" as you.
    Find a common denomiator, don't re-invent the wheel, and combine resources.
  * content annotations:
    lack of exchange format definitions/standards
  * Except for: IIIF.io

# Puh. Where to begin?

> It's a database and some UI possibly referring to files.
> Designed to find and organize stuff.

  * **CMS:** Collection Management System
  * **MAM:** Media Asset Management
  * **DAM:** [Digital Asset Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset_management)


<aside class="notes">
CMS usually includes a MAM, and a MAM is a media-type-aware version of a DAM.

Disclaimer: DAMs or MAMs may be used for preservation, but are sometimes/often
not designed or intended for use in a preservation context, but merely to store
and handle "digital assets": from regular office files (documents, images, etc)
to managing in-house assets of larger companies. And some of these systems were
then "also" used by archives.

The term "Collection Management System" usually indicates that it was more
likely intended to be used in a preservation context, such as museums for
example - where it may be used beyond digital: To handle physical collections
even, like books, chairs, or anything. And files ;)

You may see the term "Collection Management System" being used interchangeably
with DAM or MAM by the preservation community.

(Note: The abbreviation "CMS" usually means
["**Content** Management System"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)
which is something completely different. In order to save some screen space, I
will use the abbreviation "CMS" in these slides however instead of typing
"Collection Management System")


A DAM is usually the generic version of MAM - and sometimes the borders between
"is it a MAM? is it a DAM?" are fuzzy and unclear, because they are so closely
related.


Typical for "classic" DAMs:
Often trimmed and designed for handling "2D material" (documents, images). When
it comes to audiovisual, they're mostly inadequate or not suitable for
archive-suitable quality media handling.

MAMs are usually better suited for handling media.
For example:

  * auto-generating access/preview copies suitable for low-bandwidth/internet/browser access.
  * image area annotation
  * time based annotation ("markers")

But watch out! Even systems designed to handle AV media, are often not taking
too much care about preservation/archival aspects. It's not uncommon that
"looks/sounds good enough!" is exactly where you're at.

So please:

  * Try *before* you buy!
  * Don't trust sales. Ever.

# ISO 8601. ü§©Ô∏è

  * **Date:**  
    1981-01-03
  * **Date &amp; Time (+TZ):**  
    1981-01-03**T**00:12:34<small>+02:00</small>
  * **Week (+weekday):**  
    2022-W46-5
  * **Duration:**  
    PnYnMnDTnHnMnS 

<cite>
See: [(Wikipedia) ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
</cite>

<aside class="notes">
Whatever you do, please:

  * Support iso8601 for date/time **input** <small>(if possible)</small>.
  * Support exporting/importing iso8601 date/time/duration strings.

You may however, want to be able to at least display date/time also in
different formats (configurable).

Why?
The "psycho-visual perception" (does it look/feel good?) of people reading
ISO8601 syntax is mixed...

  * Standalone dates: ok.
    Sometimes cleaner to read than written date.
    Sometimes not.

  * Date+Time: rather hard to grasp visually.
    (Add a timezone and you've lost most operator staff)

  * Duration: Forget it.
    Hard to read as a person.

**Examples:**

   * 1981-01-03 (nice) vs January 3rd, 1981 (warmer)
   * 1981-01-03T20:15+01:00 (uck.)
    

Here's a link to documents from the US LoC, about rules and extensions for
date/time cataloging:

  * [LoC: WD8601-2\_2016 Representation of dates and times (Part 1: Basic Rules)](https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/iso-tc154-wg5_n0038_iso_wd_8601-1_2016-02-16.pdf)
  * [LoC: WD8601-2\_2016 Representation of dates and times (Part 2: Extensions)](https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/iso-tc154-wg5_n0039_iso_wd_8601-2_2016-02-16.pdf)
</aside>



# Duration / Period

  * Support having "from/to" in date fields?
  * With different, even mixed "precision"?
    * "1920-1923"
    * "1920-01 - 1923"


# Got "Fuzzy" Dates...?

  * 1910-01?
  * circa 1800?
  * Bronce age
  * WWII
  * etc.

> Oh, btw: Got a [common syntax](https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/iso-tc154-wg5_n0039_iso_wd_8601-2_2016-02-16.pdf)?

<aside class="notes">
Seems trivial, but it makes sense to support fuzzy date/time.

To my knowledge, there's no standard for fuzzy-dates (ISO8601 doesn't cover
that).

The US Library of Congress (LoC) has issued extension rules for datetime
issues, that include suggestions for approximate and uncertain date/time
values, as well as general rules for handling this for cataloging:

  * [LoC: WD8601-2\_2016 Representation of dates and times (Part 1: Basic Rules)](https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/iso-tc154-wg5_n0038_iso_wd_8601-1_2016-02-16.pdf)

# Partially Approximately Uncertain?

  * "**?**": Uncertain
  * "**~**": Approximate (circa)
  * "**%**": Both uncertain &amp; approximate
  * "**X**": Unspecified.

# The Identifer

A "*must have*". Also known as:

  * Object ID, Item ID, ...
  * Archive signature
  * [UID: Unique ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_identifier)
  * [UUID: Universally Unique ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)
  * [PID: Persistent ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_identifier)
  * ...

<aside class="notes">
Questions:
  * For what reason(s) would you want/need an identifier?
  * Why is it desirable that it's unique?
  * Why is it desirable that it's persistent?
  * What's the scope that ID shall be used for?
    This has great influence on choosing its properties, like:
    persistence, uniqueness, recognizability, etc.

# PIDs - Persistent Identifiers

  Example: **NHMW-ZOO-FS50750**

> "[PIDs] provide [means for offering] a long-lasting click-able link to a digital object."
>
> <cite>(Source: [https://tanc-ahrc.github.io/HeritagePIDs/](https://tanc-ahrc.github.io/HeritagePIDs/)</cite>



# PIDs - Infos

  * "[Heritage PID Resources](https://tanc-ahrc.github.io/PIDResources/)"



# ID Requirements

  * Unique? Persistent?
  * Stable syntax?
  * Recognizable?
  * Scope?
  * Filename-safe?
  * Printable? <small>(QR- or barcode label)</small>



# DAM-handle it?

  * Auto-generate?
  * Increment?
  * Validate?
  * More than 1 syntax?

<aside class="notes">
If you're dealing with different entity- and object-types, that require
different identifier-syntaxes:
Check if your DAM supports different ID-syntax for these cases in parallel,
without conflicts.
</aside>



# Common terms?

> "We've always called it that way, so it's clear."

  * Person, Company, Actor or: **Agent**?
  * Recording, Film, Video or: **MovingImage**?
  * Action, Shooting or: **Event**?
  * Author or: **Creator**?
  * etc.

**Can you re-label terms in the UI?**

<aside class="notes">
I'm very sure, most use-cases are not unique.
As said before: If someone else is collecting and cataloguing and managing
similar items or has similar use-cases, please get in contact with each other.

But: As great as sharing and using common CoVocs is, it brings the "problem" that
you need to agree on common terms. :)

This can sometimes be trivial, and otherwise be non-trivial - and even very
emotional.  Practically, a major issue is often that different domains have
different terms in their professional vocabularies already - which are (or may
be) mis-interpreted or confusing for other domains.  

> "But we call it '...' - and calling it '...' may completely confuse our operators"

Example: The term "Agent" ;)


Be ready for trade-offs.
Be ready to use different, but now common, terms.
</aside>

<!-- 
Controlled vocabularies and lists
-->

# Controlled Vocabularies

> "Controlled vocabulary schemes mandate the use of predefined, authorised
> terms that have been preselected by the designers of the schemes, in contrast
> to natural language vocabularies, which have no such restriction."

<small>Source: ["Controlled Vocabulary" (Wikipedia)"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_vocabulary)</small>


# Why CoVocs / Taxonomies?

> Same-same üòá, but different... üò≠

  * **35mm** = 35 mm = 35 millim√®tre
  * **dup pos** = duplicate positive
  * **de** = deu = german = German = alem√°n
  * **yuv422p10le** = YUV, 4:2:2, 10 bpc
  * **Director** = Directed by = Regisseur = Regie

<aside class="notes">
**Controlled vocabulary:**
Be very greedy with "free text" fields, as they lead to chaos, disorder and mayhem!

On the other hand:
It's always good to have "some" field where to put the "doesn't go anywhere
else" stuff. And it may also be useful/necessary to be able to store/preserve
the original terms "as-is", since mapping different sources to a vocabulary may
not be as straight forward or exact as one would hope.

Oh and other mapping fun:
  * Typos do happen! "35mn" anyone?
  * 1967-06-07-12 (Date with a "sort index" hack added in Freetext field)
</aside>



# Handling CoVocs

  * Clear choice/definition of terms?
  * Standard terms? <small>(e.g. ISO mapping for Language, Country, Region, Tech-Terms, etc.)</small>
  * Keyboard shortcuts to select specific terms?
  * Nested hierarchies?!
  * Maintaining / augmenting terms?
  * Identifier vs Label?



# Identifier &amp; Label

> Can the MAM store &amp; handle this properly?  

| Identifier<small>(for machines)</small> | Label<small>(for humans>) | Translations? |
| ------------------------ | --------------| ------------- |
| `sq`, `sqi`, `alb`, ...  | Albanian      | Albanisch<sup>(de)</sup>, Albanais<sup>(fr)</sup>    |
| `de`, `deu`, `ger`, ...  | German        | Deutsch<sup>(de)</sup>, Allemand<sup>(fr)</sup>      |
| `und`                    | Undetermined  | ...?                   |

<small>
Examples: 
[ISO 639 (Languages)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes),
[ISO 3166 (Countries)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1),...
</small>

<aside class="notes">
Separating label from identifier, has the following benefits:

  * Label can be translated arbitrarily.
  * The meaning of the data stored is (more) "clear".
    Less options for mis-interpretation errors.
  * Can even be (more easily) upgraded to shared CoVocs and Linked Open Data in
    the future.
  * Import/Export and exchange with others (and systems) greatly improved.
</aside>



# Shared CoVocs

  * Same vocabulary terms/lists can be 
    used across different systems/domains.
  * Use existing CoVocs where possible.
  * Share/publish yours.
  * Be in contact/exchange with others.
  * Be ready for embracing trade-offs.



# Dynamic CoVocs

> How does your DAM deal with:

  * Adding new terms (on the fly)?
  * Editing terms that have already been assigned...? üò±Ô∏è
  * Import / export lists?

<aside class="notes">
It's quite unrealistic to assume any term-list will not change over time.
Depening on how a DAM system is designed/built under the hood, it may (or may
not) handle changes to term-lists well.

Try to assign terms to records, then change/move/re-label/etc those
already-assigned terms.

Some DAMs store terms by references (usually some form of identifier), others
store the actual value at the time the term was assigned to a field.

Both have their pros and cons, yet with data being more and more required to
become "flexible" and interoperable, it is more likely that being able to
handle term-assignments dynamically will be the preference for future-proof
systems.

</aside>

# Shared Identifiers

> If you're not the only one referring to ...
>
> Wouldn't it make sense to have a common,
> shared identifier?

<aside class="notes">
With data being exchanged and aggregated, it's becoming more interesting (and practically important) to include identifiers from different sources, to be able to relate database entries with each other.

A typical scenario is:

  * in-house identifier
  * additional external identifier(s), like IDs for Agents.
  * external identifier from data source.  
    Example: When merging multiple collections into one.


Increasingly popular:

  * Store Wikidata identifier to relate to common entries.
</aside>


# Handling Multiple IDs?

Add attribute option declaring "which" identifier:

`<id schema="dnb"> ... </id>`  
`<id schema="efg"> ... </id>`  
`<id schema="wikidata"> Q84199 </id>`  

<aside class="notes">
This is a very simple "attribute" added to an identifier field.
This example was taken from EN15907 standard for cataloguing cinematographic
works.

# Data Structure Matters

> "classical" catalogue = flat, table/cell thinking.

  * Better: Identify **Entities** and **Attributes**.
  * Then: Identify **Relationships** <small>(and their "`@`")</small>
  * [Entity Relationship Model (ERM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model)
  * Think in "[Semantic Triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple)":  
    `Subject - Predicate - Object`

<cite>
Example [elgrito.witness.org](https://elgrito.witness.org/portfolio/metadata-entities/)
</cite>

<aside class="notes">
Inspiration for terms, but IMO not useful because the relationships combine
more than 1 thing, therefore their approach is by definition built to lead to
thousands of "terms", which actually describe too much - and cannot be combined
and re-used properly: [rda-registry.info](http://www.rdaregistry.info/)

Good idea to put terms in a version control system - and publish them. Like this:

# Relationships

  * **Forward**: Agent1 `is parent` of Agent2
  * **Reverse**: Agent2 `is child` of Agent1

<aside class="notes">
How (and if) a MAM handles relationships, their terms, directions - and their
attributes - plays a major role, not only for modelling your data, but
especially for search/retrieval and other future usage of whatever you've put
in there.

# Reference between Catalogue and Files

  * How are catalogue entries related to files (and vice-versa)?
  * How (in)dependent of the catalogue can files be used/modified?


# Filename &amp; Folder structure

  * Many DAMs do that automatically.
  * In a non-human readable layout ([UUIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)).
  * Which level of control do you need over this?
  * Got external workflows accessing the files/data?


# Files intact, but DAM gone?

![If your files have PIDs, you're lucky!](../../../images/misc/needle-in-haystack.jpg)

<aside class="notes">
It's good practice to somehow embed vitally necessary metadata with/inside your files that may help to identify and (re-)assign them if they got "lost" in the wild.

For example, having its "title" and some form of persistent identifier (PID) with your files, makes your data setup more robust against critical database or other failures.

See  "[Heritage PID Resources](https://tanc-ahrc.github.io/PIDResources/)" for more information on how to create and use PIDs.

# Got Plugins?

  * Usually an all-in-one monolith is rigid and hard to maintain.
  * Preferred: Slim core + additional features as plugins.
  * Necessary: Plugin interfaces open &amp; documented.


# Got Support?

  * Whom to call in case of ...?
  * Option to switch/choose "your mechanic"?
  * Under which conditions?
  * Support contracts?
  * Which license model?
  * Train your staff?
  * Proper documentation?

# Good practice

  * Get access to a demo installation (local or online).
  * Try to import/export lists/CoVocs.
  * Consider import/export/ui-feel with *your* data (layout).
    <small>(*Before* you make any final choice)</small>
  * Get cataloguers *&amp;* technicians together.
  * Get help from experts with your tool-choice/use-cases.
  * As simple as possible, as complicated as necessary.

# Have a disaster-plan ready.

  * Backups?
  * Failover system?
  * Got support contracts?
  * Aware of migration requirements?

# Oh, btw: "Says who?"

  * Declare information sources?
  * At which level? <small>(record? field?)</small>
  * Who edited which field when and why?
  * Could a source be "linked"? <small>(as relationship)</small>
  * What if you have &ge; 1 sources?


# Oh, there's a typo...

  * Should we correct it?
  * Is it even a typo, or was it proper "back then"?
  * Can we keep multiple "versions"?
  * (Where) can we document that? <small>(commit msg)</small>
