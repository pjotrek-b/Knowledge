# Abstract

Choosing any digital asset management system is a huge commitment, and
configuring the system to support a given data model (eg a certain ISO
Standard), is quite a non-trivial task.

There are certain things one would like to:

  * get right
  * avoid in the first place
  * have better metadata in the end
  * exchange data with others

What are controlled-vocabularies? keys-values? relationships? agents? LoD?
iso639? XSDs? - and how to make your life easier when dealing with
importing/exporting or implementing metadata layouts in a (media) asset
management system.

This may also influence your choice of DAMs:
Can it handle *your* data structure needs?
-->



<!--
Ideas:

  * mention basic ISO standards (date/time, lang, countries, etc)
  * don't invent your own terms, if there's a better source to reference
  * before you start anything new:
    Unless you're the only one with "that kind of collection":
    Speak with others who are in the same "business" as you.
    Find a common denomiator, don't re-invent the wheel, and combine resources.
  * content annotations:
    lack of exchange format definitions/standards
  * Except for: IIIF.io

Data Models and DAMs: Presentation content overview

# Overview

  * Date/time formats
  * Controlled vocabulary lists
  * Import/Export abilities
  * Metadata Standards compliance
  * "Classic" vs "Entity relationships"


# Not all DAMs are created equal.

  * Which use-cases was it designed for?
  * Proper media-type handling? <small>(image, docs, AV?)</small>
  * Multiple data schemas in parallel?
  * Local app vs browser-based?
  * License model?
  * Setup/maintenance complexity?

<aside class="notes">
But watch out! Even systems designed to handle AV media, are often not taking
too much care about preservation/archival aspects. It's not uncommon that 
"looks/sounds good enough!" is exactly where you're at.

So please:

  * Try *before* you buy!
  * Don't trust sales too much...
  * Speak with others who have the same use-cases (or system).

# Date and Time Formats

A classic.  
Never gets "old". üòúÔ∏è



# Date Formats

| Dates | Times |
| ----- | ----- |
| January 3rd, 1981     | 13:37         |
| 3. J√§nner 1981        | 13:37:00      | 
| 1/3/1981              | 0h13m37s      |

Timezones?  
Other calendar systems...?



# ISO 8601. ü§©Ô∏è

  * **Date:**  
    1981-01-03
  * **Date &amp; Time (+TZ):**  
    1981-01-03**T**00:12:34<small>+02:00</small>
  * **Week (+weekday):**  
    2022-W46-5
  * **Duration:**  
    PnYnMnDTnHnMnS 

<cite>
See: [(Wikipedia) ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
</cite>

<aside class="notes">
Whatever you do, please:

  * Support iso8601 for date/time **input** <small>(if possible)</small>.
  * Support exporting/importing iso8601 date/time/duration strings.

You may however, want to be able to at least display date/time also in
different formats (configurable).

Why?
The "psycho-visual perception" (does it look/feel good?) of people reading
ISO8601 syntax is mixed...

  * Standalone dates: ok.
    Sometimes cleaner to read than written date.
    Sometimes not.

  * Date+Time: rather hard to grasp visually.
    (Add a timezone and you've lost most operator staff)

  * Duration: Forget it.
    Hard to read as a person.

**Examples:**

   * 1981-01-03 (nice) vs January 3rd, 1981 (warmer)
   * 1981-01-03T20:15+01:00 (uck.)
    

Here's a link to documents from the US LoC, about rules and extensions for
date/time cataloging:

  * [LoC: WD8601-2\_2016 Representation of dates and times (Part 1: Basic Rules)](https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/iso-tc154-wg5_n0038_iso_wd_8601-1_2016-02-16.pdf)
  * [LoC: WD8601-2\_2016 Representation of dates and times (Part 2: Extensions)](https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/iso-tc154-wg5_n0039_iso_wd_8601-2_2016-02-16.pdf)
</aside>



# Duration / Period

  * Support having "from/to" in date fields?
  * With different, even mixed "precision"?
    * "1920-1923"
    * "1920-01 - 1923"


# Got "Fuzzy" Dates...?

  * 1910-01?
  * circa 1800?
  * Bronce age
  * WWII
  * etc.

> Oh, btw: Got a [common syntax](https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/iso-tc154-wg5_n0039_iso_wd_8601-2_2016-02-16.pdf)?

<aside class="notes">
Seems trivial, but it makes sense to support fuzzy date/time.

To my knowledge, there's no standard for fuzzy-dates (ISO8601 doesn't cover
that).

The US Library of Congress (LoC) has issued extension rules for datetime
issues, that include suggestions for approximate and uncertain date/time
values, as well as general rules for handling this for cataloging:

  * [LoC: WD8601-2\_2016 Representation of dates and times (Part 1: Basic Rules)](https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/iso-tc154-wg5_n0038_iso_wd_8601-1_2016-02-16.pdf)

</aside>


# Partially Approximately Uncertain?

  * "**?**": Uncertain
  * "**~**": Approximate (circa)
  * "**%**": Both uncertain &amp; approximate
  * "**X**": Unspecified.

> 1981-01?, 20XX, 197X-11?-XX

# MD-Standards: Some of Them

  * [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/):
    <small>Core fields (&amp; their names)</small>
  * [METS](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/):
    <small>(MD container) descriptive, administrative, structural</small>
  * [PREMIS](http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/):

# Common Entity Terms

![](../../../images/metadata/en15907-entities.png){width=600px}

<aside class="notes">
The image graph shows the basic entity-relationship layout of the EN15907
metadata standard for cataloging cinematographic works.

Even if you have nothing to do with cataloging of cinematographic works, there
are certain names for common entities here, which are already common terms
even in other metadata models:

  * Work / Variant / Manifestation (FRBR)
  * Agent
  * Event

</aside>

# Common terms?

> "We've always called it that way, so it's clear."

  * Person, Company, Actor or: **Agent**?
  * Recording, Film, Video or: **MovingImage**?
  * Action, Shooting or: **Event**?
  * Author or: **Creator**?
  * etc.

**Can you re-label terms in the UI?**

<aside class="notes">
I'm very sure, most use-cases are not unique.
As said before: If someone else is collecting and cataloguing and managing
similar items or has similar use-cases, please get in contact with each other.

But: As great as sharing and using common CoVocs is, it brings the "problem" that
you need to agree on common terms. :)

This can sometimes be trivial, and otherwise be non-trivial - and even very
emotional.  Practically, a major issue is often that different domains have
different terms in their professional vocabularies already - which are (or may
be) mis-interpreted or confusing for other domains.  

> "But we call it '...' - and calling it '...' may completely confuse our operators"

Example: The term "Agent" ;)


Be ready for trade-offs.
Be ready to use different, but now common, terms.

It may seem trivial, but agreeing on calling these collection-agnostic, basic
fields by certain names already made your data-handling life easier (and more
compatible).

Controlled vocabularies and lists

# Controlled Vocabularies

> "Controlled vocabulary schemes mandate the use of predefined, authorised
> terms that have been preselected by the designers of the schemes, in contrast
> to natural language vocabularies, which have no such restriction."

<small>Source: ["Controlled Vocabulary" (Wikipedia)"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_vocabulary)</small>


# Why CoVocs / Taxonomies?

> Same-same üòá, but different... üò≠

  * **35mm** = 35 mm = 35 millim√®tre
  * **dup pos** = duplicate positive
  * **de** = deu = german = German = alem√°n
  * **yuv422p10le** = YUV, 4:2:2, 10 bpc
  * **Director** = Directed by = Regisseur = Regie

<aside class="notes">
**Controlled vocabulary:**
Be very greedy with "free text" fields, as they lead to chaos, disorder and mayhem!

On the other hand:
It's always good to have "some" field where to put the "doesn't go anywhere
else" stuff. And it may also be useful/necessary to be able to store/preserve
the original terms "as-is", since mapping different sources to a vocabulary may
not be as straight forward or exact as one would hope.

Oh and other mapping fun:
  * Typos do happen! "35mn" anyone?
  * 1967-06-07-12 (Date with a "sort index" hack added in Freetext field)
</aside>



# Handling CoVocs

  * Clear choice/definition of terms?
  * Standard terms? <small>(e.g. ISO mapping for Language, Country, Region, Tech-Terms, etc.)</small>
  * Keyboard shortcuts to select specific terms?
  * Nested hierarchies?!
  * Maintaining / augmenting terms?
  * Identifier vs Label?



# Identifier &amp; Label

> Can the MAM store &amp; handle this properly?  

| Identifier<small>(for machines)</small> | Label<small>(for humans>) | Translations? |
| ------------------------ | --------------| ------------- |
| `sq`, `sqi`, `alb`, ...  | Albanian      | Albanisch<sup>(de)</sup>, Albanais<sup>(fr)</sup>    |
| `de`, `deu`, `ger`, ...  | German        | Deutsch<sup>(de)</sup>, Allemand<sup>(fr)</sup>      |
| `und`                    | Undetermined  | ...?                   |

<small>
Examples: 
[ISO 639 (Languages)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes),
[ISO 3166 (Countries)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1),...
</small>

<aside class="notes">
Separating label from identifier, has the following benefits:

  * Label can be translated arbitrarily.
  * The meaning of the data stored is (more) "clear".
    Less options for mis-interpretation errors.
  * Can even be (more easily) upgraded to shared CoVocs and Linked Open Data in
    the future.
  * Import/Export and exchange with others (and systems) greatly improved.
</aside>



# Shared CoVocs

  * Same vocabulary terms/lists can be 
    used across different systems/domains.
  * Use existing CoVocs where possible.
  * Share/publish yours.
  * Be in contact/exchange with others.
  * Be ready for embracing trade-offs.



# Dynamic CoVocs

> How does your DAM deal with:

  * Adding new terms (on the fly)?
  * Editing terms that have already been assigned...? üò±Ô∏è
  * Import / export lists?

<aside class="notes">
It's quite unrealistic to assume any term-list will not change over time.
Depening on how a DAM system is designed/built under the hood, it may (or may
not) handle changes to term-lists well.

Try to assign terms to records, then change/move/re-label/etc those
already-assigned terms.

Some DAMs store terms by references (usually some form of identifier), others
store the actual value at the time the term was assigned to a field.

Both have their pros and cons, yet with data being more and more required to
become "flexible" and interoperable, it is more likely that being able to
handle term-assignments dynamically will be the preference for future-proof
systems.

# Shared Identifiers

> If you're not the only one referring to ...
>
> Wouldn't it make sense to have a common,
> shared identifier?

<aside class="notes">
With data being exchanged and aggregated, it's becoming more interesting (and practically important) to include identifiers from different sources, to be able to relate database entries with each other.

A typical scenario is:

  * in-house identifier
  * additional external identifier(s), like IDs for Agents.
  * external identifier from data source.  
    Example: When merging multiple collections into one.


Increasingly popular:

  * Store Wikidata identifier to relate to common entries.
</aside>


# Handling Multiple IDs?

Add attribute option declaring "which" identifier:

`<id schema="dnb"> ... </id>`  
`<id schema="efg"> ... </id>`  
`<id schema="wikidata"> Q84199 </id>`  

<aside class="notes">
This is a very simple "attribute" added to an identifier field.
This example was taken from EN15907 standard for cataloguing cinematographic
works.

# Data Structure Matters

> "classical" catalogue = flat, table/cell thinking.

  * Better: Identify **Entities** and **Attributes**.
  * Then: Identify **Relationships** <small>(and their "`@`")</small>
  * [Entity Relationship Model (ERM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model)
  * Think in "[Semantic Triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple)":  
    `Subject - Predicate - Object`

<cite>
Example [elgrito.witness.org](https://elgrito.witness.org/portfolio/metadata-entities/)
</cite>

<aside class="notes">
Inspiration for terms, but IMO not useful because the relationships combine
more than 1 thing, therefore their approach is by definition built to lead to
thousands of "terms", which actually describe too much - and cannot be combined
and re-used properly: [rda-registry.info](http://www.rdaregistry.info/)

Good idea to put terms in a version control system - and publish them. Like this:
[RDA registry on Github](https://github.com/RDARegistry/RDA-Vocabularies/tree/master/csv/Elements)
</aside>



# Relationships

![](../../../images/metadata/erm/erm_rel1.png)

  * **Forward**: Agent1 `is parent` of Agent2
  * **Reverse**: Agent2 `is child` of Agent1

<aside class="notes">
How (and if) a MAM handles relationships, their terms, directions - and their
attributes - plays a major role, not only for modelling your data, but
especially for search/retrieval and other future usage of whatever you've put
in there.
</aside>



# Annotating relationships

  * For which time-period was the relationship valid?
    <small>(Agent "married to" Agent)</small>

  * Anything else you'd like to add?

<aside class="notes">
</aside>



# Relationship queries?

> (How well) can a system handle/search relationship-details?

* Which Work(s) feature which Agent(s) under the alias of ...?
* List all ... related to a work, in order of their ...?

# Schema Validation
## What are XSDs?

  * In machine readable form.
  * Used for automated metadata schema validation.

<aside class="notes">
LoD is still a bit "new", and there are many many many things to be considered,
tested, found out, implemented, improved, etc. Yet, having isolated catalogues
and maintaining all entitites individually, does not seem like a long-term
sustainable approach.

However, many archives are still using conventional "flat" data models, local
CoVocs - and are slowly transitioning towards shared CoVocs and
Entity-Relationship models.

If you are interested in more hands-on practical experience with LoD and interoperability of data, you may want to get in touch with the FIAF cataloging commission, who is very actively charting the new territory of
archives and LoD.

There's a short summary from a
[FIAF LoD Workshop in 2019](https://www.fiafnet.org/pages/E-Resources/LoD-Task-Force-Workshop-2019.html), 
which contains very valuable overviews and insights in a quick read :)
