# Access &amp; Exchange: Data Formats

<aside class="notes">
The options for accessing, exchanging - basically working with your data - play
an increasingly important role in the choice of any catalogue / MAM.


| quality | description |
| -------:| ----------- |
|       ★ | make your stuff available on the Web (whatever format) under an open license  |
|      ★★ | make it available as structured data (e.g., Excel instead of image scan of a table) |
|     ★★★ | make it available in a non-proprietary open format (e.g., CSV instead of Excel) |
|    ★★★★ | use URIs to denote things, so that people can point at your stuff |
|   ★★★★★ | link your data to other data to provide context |

LoD is still a bit "new", and there are many many many things to be considered,
tested, found out, implemented, improved, etc. Yet, having isolated catalogues
and maintaining all entitites individually, does not seem like a long-term
sustainable approach.

However, many archives are still using conventional "flat" data models, local
CoVocs - and are slowly transitioning towards shared CoVocs and
Entity-Relationship models.

If you are interested in more hands-on practical experience with LoD and interoperability of data, you may want to get in touch with the FIAF cataloging commission, who is very actively charting the new territory of
archives and LoD.

There's a short summary from a
[FIAF LoD Workshop in 2019](https://www.fiafnet.org/pages/E-Resources/LoD-Task-Force-Workshop-2019.html), 
which contains very valuable overviews and insights in a quick read :)
