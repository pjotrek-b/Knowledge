  * **CMS:** Collection Management System
  * **MAM:** Media Asset Management
  * **DAM:** [Digital Asset Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset_management)


<aside class="notes">
CMS usually includes a MAM, and a MAM is a media-type-aware version of a DAM.

Disclaimer: DAMs or MAMs may be used for preservation, but are sometimes/often
not designed or intended for use in a preservation context, but merely to store
and handle "digital assets": from regular office files (documents, images, etc)
to managing in-house assets of larger companies. And some of these systems were
then "also" used by archives.

The term "Collection Management System" usually indicates that it was more
likely intended to be used in a preservation context, such as museums for
example - where it may be used beyond digital: To handle physical collections
even, like books, chairs, or anything. And files ;)

You may see the term "Collection Management System" being used interchangeably
with DAM or MAM by the preservation community.

(Note: The abbreviation "CMS" usually means
["**Content** Management System"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)
which is something completely different. In order to save some screen space, I
will use the abbreviation "CMS" in these slides however instead of typing
"Collection Management System")


A DAM is usually the generic version of MAM - and sometimes the borders between
"is it a MAM? is it a DAM?" are fuzzy and unclear, because they are so closely
related.


Typical for "classic" DAMs:
Often trimmed and designed for handling "2D material" (documents, images). When
it comes to audiovisual, they're mostly inadequate or not suitable for
archive-suitable quality media handling.

MAMs are usually better suited for handling media.
For example:

  * auto-generating access/preview copies suitable for low-bandwidth/internet/browser access.
  * image area annotation
  * time based annotation ("markers")

But watch out! Even systems designed to handle AV media, are often not taking
too much care about preservation/archival aspects. It's not uncommon that
"looks/sounds good enough!" is exactly where you're at.

So please:

  * Try *before* you buy!
  * Don't trust sales. Ever.
