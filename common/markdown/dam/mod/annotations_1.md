Content Annotations.

# Content annotations

In difference to regular descriptive metadata:

  * Image annotations?
  * Time-based annotations?
  * Import/Export/Exchange of content annotations?



# Lack of Standards

  * AV: Simple markerlists (EDLs)?
  * Time offset units:    
    Frame? Audio-sample? Timecode? (nano-)seconds?



# IIIF.io

  * [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](https://iiif.io/)
  * Zooooooomable images.
  * Content annotation standards!  
    (image regions, text-segments, time-based sequences)
  * For AV, too: [iiif-av (GitHub)](https://github.com/IIIF/iiif-av/issues?page=2&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)
