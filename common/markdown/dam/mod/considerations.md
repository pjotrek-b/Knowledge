# Considerations

<small>

  * CoVocs: Ability to have ID and label?
  * Multiple MD-schemas in parallel?
    e.g. Different entry types: film, image, documents, physical objects, etc
  * Can it be used to implement a certain Standard?
  * Import/Export abilities (data and files)?
  * Field mapping/translation?
  * Content (file) storage layout?
    <small>(naming, folder structure, links)</small>
  * Complexity of hardware/software setup?
    <small>(For setup, maintenance and migration)</small>
  * What if your MAM is gone/broken?
  * Artificial restrictions for future support/migrations?
  * Access levels: Who may access/edit/etc which parts?
  * Browser-based vs local client application
  * Got support?
