<aside class="notes">
The image graph shows the basic entity-relationship layout of the EN15907
metadata standard for cataloging cinematographic works.

Even if you have nothing to do with cataloging of cinematographic works, there
are certain names for common entities here, which are already common terms
even in other metadata models:

  * Work / Variant / Manifestation (FRBR)
  * Agent
  * Event
