# Not all DAMs are created equal.

  * Which use-cases was it designed for?
  * Proper media-type handling? <small>(image, docs, AV?)</small>
  * Multiple data schemas in parallel?
  * Local app vs browser-based?
  * License model?
  * Setup/maintenance complexity?

<aside class="notes">
But watch out! Even systems designed to handle AV media, are often not taking
too much care about preservation/archival aspects. It's not uncommon that 
"looks/sounds good enough!" is exactly where you're at.

So please:

  * Try *before* you buy!
  * Don't trust sales too much...
  * Speak with others who have the same use-cases (or system).
