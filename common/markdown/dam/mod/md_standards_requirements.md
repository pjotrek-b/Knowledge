# MAM Requirements for MD-Standards

  * Store ID/ISO values (or just label)?
  * Relationships between different schema?
  * Import/export schema support?
  * Field labels in UI vs "The Standard Terms"?
  * Watch out for "EEE":  
    [Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish)

<aside class="notes">
**EEE:**
Although the phrase "Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish" was invented by
Microsoft, the principle is neither new, nor limited to their company:

With any standard, it may be so that someone implements it, but then feels like
adding an additional field (for whatever reason). This may seem fine at first,
but may lead to interoperability issues pretty fast.

If possible, pay attention to how "proper" someone/some system implements a
certain Standard if they claim to do so. Sometimes this happens by best
intentions, by accident or by strategic intentions.

In any case, you may have to deal/suffer from the consequences.
