# Common terms?

> "We've always called it that way, so it's clear."

  * Person, Company, Actor or: **Agent**?
  * Recording, Film, Video or: **MovingImage**?
  * Action, Shooting or: **Event**?
  * Author or: **Creator**?
  * etc.

**Can you re-label terms in the UI?**

<aside class="notes">
I'm very sure, most use-cases are not unique.
As said before: If someone else is collecting and cataloguing and managing
similar items or has similar use-cases, please get in contact with each other.

But: As great as sharing and using common CoVocs is, it brings the "problem" that
you need to agree on common terms. :)

This can sometimes be trivial, and otherwise be non-trivial - and even very
emotional.  Practically, a major issue is often that different domains have
different terms in their professional vocabularies already - which are (or may
be) mis-interpreted or confusing for other domains.  

> "But we call it '...' - and calling it '...' may completely confuse our operators"

Example: The term "Agent" ;)


Be ready for trade-offs.
Be ready to use different, but now common, terms.
