# Oh, btw: "Says who?"

  * Declare information sources?
  * At which level? <small>(record? field?)</small>
  * Who edited which field when and why?
  * Could a source be "linked"? <small>(as relationship)</small>
  * What if you have &ge; 1 sources?


# Oh, there's a typo...

  * Should we correct it?
  * Is it even a typo, or was it proper "back then"?
  * Can we keep multiple "versions"?
  * (Where) can we document that? <small>(commit msg)</small>
