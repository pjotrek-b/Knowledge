<aside class="notes">
Whatever you do, please:

  * Support iso8601 for date/time **input** <small>(if possible)</small>.
  * Support exporting/importing iso8601 date/time/duration strings.

You may however, want to be able to at least display date/time also in
different formats (configurable).

Why?
The "psycho-visual perception" (does it look/feel good?) of people reading
ISO8601 syntax is mixed...

  * Standalone dates: ok.
    Sometimes cleaner to read than written date.
    Sometimes not.

  * Date+Time: rather hard to grasp visually.
    (Add a timezone and you've lost most operator staff)

  * Duration: Forget it.
    Hard to read as a person.

**Examples:**

   * 1981-01-03 (nice) vs January 3rd, 1981 (warmer)
   * 1981-01-03T20:15+01:00 (uck.)
