# Abstract

Choosing any digital asset management system is a huge commitment, and
configuring the system to support a given data model (eg a certain ISO
Standard), is quite a non-trivial task.

There are certain things one would like to:

  * get right
  * avoid in the first place
  * have better metadata in the end
  * exchange data with others

What are controlled-vocabularies? keys-values? relationships? agents? LoD?
iso639? XSDs? - and how to make your life easier when dealing with
importing/exporting or implementing metadata layouts in a (media) asset
management system.

This may also influence your choice of DAMs:
Can it handle *your* data structure needs?

<!--
Ideas:

  * mention basic ISO standards (date/time, lang, countries, etc)
  * don't invent your own terms, if there's a better source to reference
  * before you start anything new:
    Unless you're the only one with "that kind of collection":
    Speak with others who are in the same "business" as you.
    Find a common denomiator, don't re-invent the wheel, and combine resources.
  * content annotations:
    lack of exchange format definitions/standards
  * Except for: IIIF.io
