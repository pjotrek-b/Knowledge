<!--
Ideas:

  * mention basic ISO standards (date/time, lang, countries, etc)

  * don't invent your own terms, if there's a better source to reference.
    * Does your DAM allow to re-label underlying terms?

  * before you start anything new:
    Unless you're the only one with "that kind of collection":
    Speak with others who are in the same "business" as you.
    Find a common denomiator, don't re-invent the wheel, and combine resources.

  * mention popular use cases
    * cataloging collection items
    * search/retrieval of digital assets    
    * web-publishing
    * loan handling
    * connected to other workflow systems
    * retrieve statistics of your collection/work
    * use digital assets/metadata to answer complex queries

  * make it clear that any choice for any DAM is a long-term commitment.

  * make it clear that:
    * FOSS licensed is important/good, because of long-term commitment.
    * Gratis is good, but can be a problem:
      * Got support?
      * Can the programmers/company keep up their work?
      * Software needs ongoing maintenance
      
    * find a provider that offers *you the choice* for install/setup yourself,
      and also offer hosting - or setup help and Q&As.

  * Decisions made at the very beginning may influence other things at different areas, and at any early/later point in your product usage.
    * Therefore it's important to have someone experienced with your chosen system to go through your use-cases, to help setting things up in a way where setup-decisions will be done with future usage/behavior in mind.

  * import/export is of essence.
    * Open Standards! OR at least a properly documented format and/or mapping mechanisms.
    * OAI-PMH
    * If XML, then with a documented schema

  * taxonomy / cvocs:
    * samesame, but different: "8mm, 8 mm, 8 millimeter, 8 millimetre"
    * import/export
    * assign by identifier or literal? (how it handles updates on existing entries)
    * value (frontend) and term-id (backend)?

  * Failsafe
    * What if stuff breaks?
    * Got a backup?
    * Got a failover system?
    * 

  * Migration

  * Links between "Meta-and-Data"
    * needle-haystack image.

  * Does it scale?



Optional features (future):

  * content annotations:
    lack of exchange format definitions/standards
  * Except for: IIIF.io


Includes:

  * ashley's CMS systems crowd-list screenshot
  * "The Metadata Standards Graph/Map" image <- Hatte Julian schon drin! :)
  * Future:
    * Linked Open Data
    * Wikidata


Screenshots from DAM tools:

  * Include them in a row, then freestyle-comment on them, jumping back and forth as needed.
  * Referencing to what's been said in the presentation before.
