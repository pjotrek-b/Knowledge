# HowTo find out /WHEN/ a particular XKCD comic was released?

Each xkcd comic has its own nice page, a title and unique-ID (index number) and everything:
["Barrel - Part 1" (xkcd #1)](https://xkcd.com/1/)

**BUT NO DATE!**

I was... surprised.


## Go to the Archive!

So in order to find out the date when that drawing was published, open the archive page, and there it says:

> "(Hover mouse over title to view publication date)"

Give it a try:

[xkcd.com/archive: Scroll dooooown to #1](https://xkcd.com/archive/)

And hover over the link saying "Barrel - Part 1", and you'll see: `2006-1-1`.


Problem solved.
Thanks xkcd!
(Not just for the date, but also for these brilliant comics)
