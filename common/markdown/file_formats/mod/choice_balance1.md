# Format choice = A balance of ...

  * Size vs Quality
  * Features
  * Performance
  * Sustainability
  * plus: time, budget, staff
  * and of course: convenience

<small>Good starting point for assessing practical usefulness.</small>

<aside class="notes">
Size:
  * Smaller = slower processing power
  * Smaller = less quality
  * Bigger = slower disk I/O

Quality:
  * More quality = larger files
  * More quality = slower processing

Performance:
  * How "fast" can a format be encoded/decoded?
  * Which hardware is required/desired?
  * Making it faster: Often limited by budget
  * Cameras / recording workflows must satisfy real-time and on-site
    constraints.
  * Editing

Features:
  * Can the format handle information/feature XY?
    (Can it do start timecode? timecode track? subtitles? extended metadata? etc)
