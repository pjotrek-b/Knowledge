> "My format is `...` than yours. Bäh!"

`Options = 😝 🤑 🤩 🤫 🤔 🤐 😴 🤮 ...`
Have fun!

<aside class="notes">
Sometimes the reason for more than 1 suitable format option existing may be,
because different vendors are interested in promoting "their" format.

If a format becomes widespread/important enough, the "owner" of that format has
a great saying/control over the conditions such files can be used/supported.
