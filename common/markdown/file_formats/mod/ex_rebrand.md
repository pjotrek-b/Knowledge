# "Rebranded" Format Names

> Some (professional) video formats are actually a profile-set for existing
> (standards) formats.

This is good! üòáÔ∏è

<aside class="notes">
Such profiles may include declaring what is "allowed" (=supported):

  * number of audio channels
  * audio resolution (samplerate, bits, channels)
  * allowed bit-rates
  * image resolutions, frame-rates
  * etc.


Why is this good?

The reason why this is a good thing is, that these formats can now be treated
with tools that support their underlying encodings, simply by adhering to their
profile-specifications, using existing file-format libraries and tools.

For example, broadcast formats can now often be handled using FFmpeg, as long
as sticking to the right profile constraints.
