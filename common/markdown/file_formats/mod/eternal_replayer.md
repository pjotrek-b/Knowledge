As an example:

  * Schematics
  * Building components
  * +the right to use, study, share and improve them.

= "The Immortal Replayer"

Because it can be kept alive, or rebuilt or adapted to future needs or with
future technology (whatever there may be).

Since software *is* the schematics and building components at the same time,
having the source code and the right (=license) to use, adapt and share them -
gives you an immortal file format. By definition.

This has been proven in the real world in many different digital domains outside
AV or preservation many times already, with different tools and data formats
from ancient computer systems. Even popular ones now dead (Atari, Amiga, C64,
Amstrad Schneider, etc etc.)
