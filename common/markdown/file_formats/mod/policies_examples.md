<aside class="notes">
The above links point to preservation policies published by other AV archival
institutions.  They also contain information about file format choices - in the
context of AV preservation.

As you can see, the length and level of detail of such policies can vary greatly.
Often it is great to simply have a rather short written form that at least
provides insights in "how" and "why" someone has chosen one (format) option
over another.

It is also good practice to write such policies in a way that they can be
interpreted and applied properly even if the actual technical
options/conditions change. For example, it's okay to say "we chose format XY" -
but without writing down "why", this choice may seem incomprehensible and
outdated once "format XY" is superseded by another format, or something else in
the tech-envirionment or the conditions has changed.

Another example: It was common to use "MP3" for some (longer) recordings in the
audio archiving domain, instead of WAV/PCM.  Now this may seem odd, but at that
time 10 MB/Minute WAV/PCM (CD-Resolution) was heavy lifting in terms of digital
computer storage.

But back then, a "large" HDD RAID was 80 GB. Consisting of several 20 GB
harddisks.  Now, this would fit on a USB-Stick.

All the time.
