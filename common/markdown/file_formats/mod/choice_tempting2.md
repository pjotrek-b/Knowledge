  * ask, ask, ask.
  * get documentation.
  * get sample files.
  * try handling/opening them *outside their "usual bubble"*.
  * with at least 1 open implementation. <small>(FOSS licensed)</small>
  * Before you commit to a format.
  * Try transcoding it to a 
    "[*lossless*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_compression)" or 
    "[*uncompressed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncompressed_video)" form.
    <small>(to know if you can migrate/convert later)</small>

<aside class="notes">
  * Ask users with similar/identical use cases than yours how they're doing with
    that format.

  * Get file format data layout specifications and other related documentation
    that you can get your hands on. We've already profited from the ones who did
    this for past "data formats": analogue ones or even ancient writings on clay
    stone tablets, etc.

  * Get sample files and try using them as-if in your desired workflow.
    Ask manufacturers or service-providers to provide you samples, or show you
    how your samples behave in their application/environment.

  * Try sample files "outside their usual bubble":
    This means that sometimes certain format behave well within expected
    environments (e.g. ProRes on Apple stuff, certain MXF-flavors in broadcast
    tools, etc) - but when deviating from thes tested grounds, things may look quite
    differently.

  * If you have at least 1 open implementation (=binary plus source code under a
    copyleft license), you have everything you need to get out of that format
    under any future conditions. Without artificial restrictions.

  * If you can transcode the format to an uncompressed form, without losing any
    information, you know that you have means of getting out of that format
    once you may decide to switch to another one (in the future).
