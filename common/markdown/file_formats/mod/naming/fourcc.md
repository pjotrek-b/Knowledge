# FourCC

# FourCC

> an identifier for a video codec, compression format,
> color or pixel format used in media files.

(FourCC is the legacy format identifier in AVI &amp; Quicktime)

<aside class="notes">
Originating from AVI/MOV, and somewhat still in use today, not all container
formats use the FourCC codes to identify stream encodings. Some keep FourCC
alongside other, container-specific, identifiers.

FourCCs are still practical handles/names to refer to a specific coding format.
You may therefore see FourCC identifiers being used as the go-to-term to
indicate certain pixel/color layouts.

For example, when configuring an analog-digital video capture source, you may see terms like:

  * UYVY
  * VYUY
  * YUY2

These are the FourCC names
