  * **Digitization:**
<small> <green>As-original, as-untouched as possible. Records in realtime?</green> </small>  
    <small> (Plus: has headroom for optional restoration/improvements.) </small>

  * **Preservation:**
<small> <green>Stand the tests of time.</green> </small>    
    <small> (Highest 'original' quality) </small>

  * **Production:**
<small> <green>For daily work. High quality.</green> </small>  
    <small> (Optional, if preservation format can be used for this) </small>

  * **Access**
<small> <green>For quick and easy access.</green> </small>  
    <small> (Quality not necessarily best/high, but very convenient to play) </small>


<aside class="notes">
Sometimes one format can be used for all these cases (merely lower
quality/bitrate for access or production), but with AV it's not uncommon that
these are different codecs (or even containers).

It is perfectly normal to have a preservation copy that requires transcoding
before going into other workflows.

The formats for access and editing are more likely to be chanced more often than
the preservation format.

Why? Because it became "<red>small enough</red>".
