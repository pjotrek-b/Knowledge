<small>"Implementation overrules paper specs. Always."</small>


<aside class="notes">
If the implementation is open: you can use, study, share and improve if
necessary.

If it's closed/proprietary then there's nothing you can do about it:
Black box. Vendor lock-in.
With digital, this means that it's quite likely that this as-is binary may not
be able to keep running/functioning when its environment changes.

You've probably seen how fast even good and stable programs "age" until they
stop working, once their native Windows version is "too long ago..."?


Even with official standards, their implementation is what creates the actual
encoding/decoding. Regardless of what's written in any paper manual (=theory): The code
implementation (=practice) is what counts.

Therefore, it makes sense to demand an openly accessible reference
implementation, with its source code under a license that allows to make use of
it as you see fit.
