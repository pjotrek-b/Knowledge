# Best practices for ingest/digitization

<small>

  * Stay as "unmodified" to the original source as possible.

  * Capture analog video without adding generation loss.  
    Uncompressed <sup>(v210)</sup> or lossless <sup>(FFV1, J2K)</sup>.

  * Or fallback option: high-quality lossy.  
    At the highest quality (bitrate) you can store and manage well over time.

  * Capture digital tape as "natively" as possible.  
    <sup>(MiniDV, DAT, DigiBeta, etc.)</sup>

  * Store already-digital files "as original" as possible.  
    Transcode only if codec does not satisfy "sustainability" checklist.
    Rewrap/rewrite container. Always. Even if identical.
