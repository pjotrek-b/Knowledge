<aside class="notes">
Be careful with "one size fits all": Sporks are good for camping, but there's a
reason why we still have separate tools for the job: spoon, knife and fork.

Considerations:

  * More features = more complex / chance that only parts of specifications are
    supported by tool X.
  * Can be non-trivial to judge what is "simple" and what is "complex"
  * Find the sweet spot for your use case(s).
