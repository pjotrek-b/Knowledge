# Lossless

> "It's like ZIP for film!"

  * No generation loss
  * Way larger than lossy
  * But: Smaller than uncompressed

<aside class="notes">
It's just a different kind of math actually.

And "lossless" merely means that every single digital bit must be preserved and
perfectly reproducible on decompression.

So: What goes in comes back out.
bit-proof.

Therefore it's like a ZIP.
But lossless AV codecs make use of their knowledge on AV-specific properties to improve their compression ratios, compared to generic ZIP, RAR, ARJ, LZW, RLE, ... etc.

Important for you to remember:

  * Lossless = best, original quality/information
  * Lossless = smaller (than uncompressed)
  * Yet, (still) way bigger than lossy.
    (Like 350 MB/min VHS, 700 MB/min DigiBeta SD, 8 bpc, stereo 48kHz/16bit)

So lossless SD is still: "just a few minutes" on a DVD.
But it's an awesome choice for an original/master copy.
