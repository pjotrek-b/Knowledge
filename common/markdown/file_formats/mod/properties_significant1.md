For some it's the resolution, color information, audio quality - for others
it's sufficient to see/understand it "good enough", or to be able to quickly
edit-and-broadcast as the main focus.

Depends.

However, be aware that your recording may possibly be used in a different
context in the future, so if possible don't aim "too low".

But please make an active decision and possibly document it (which ones and
why) somewhere.

Definition fuzziness in the preservation community:

and decided how to deal with them".

Further properties:
  * scan type (interlaced / progressive) 
  * field order
  * color information
