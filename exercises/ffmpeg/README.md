Sintel example is awesome for showing "from image+audio to video and back" - but for starters it's better to simply "rewrap and transcode" a videofile.

It's just very confusing to deal with printf-syntax, and multiple input/output arguments - if you see FFmpeg for the first time.

Rather use some videos from the "Trinity Testset".
